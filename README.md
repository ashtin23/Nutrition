# Nutrition Tracker

This application is a simplified version of MyFitnessPal, by Under Armour. In essence, it allows the user to search the USDA database for common foods to see their nutritional values. If the user is unsure of what food they would like to search for, they may also view a list of common foods. 

# Planning

The application, in its current state, is my MVP. In the future, I plan on adding many more features. Below are the Bronze, Silver, and Gold models of my application.

## Bronze

The Bronze version of my application is the MVP, which is the current state of my application. 

## Silver


## Gold

Thie Gold version will more closely resemble the MyFitnessPal that we know and love. I will expand the database to allow the user to search for more brand name foods, as well as food served in popular restaurants. Also, the user will be able to input their daily intake of food into a food journal/diary, which will automatically calculate their daily calories, as well as their daily intake of macronutrients.
